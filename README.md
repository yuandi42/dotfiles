## Programs for my daily use.
### Basic
Display sever: X-org. Is there really another decent choice?

Compositor: picom. It works pretty well without heavily config.

Window manager: qtile. It has a panel with tons of built-in widget. Great for a newbie like me.

Display manager: lightdm with lightdm-gtk-greeter.

Notification server: dunst.

Clipboard manager: xclip.

Hotkey daemon: sxhkd. It takes over most my hotkeys of scripts and other non-WM-related keybindings. May help a lot if one day I decide to do a WM hopping.

Terminal: alacritty. An easily customizable terminal.

Shell: bash which every noobs use, with starship prompt as my shell prompt.

Web browser: qutebrowser. Its vim-keybinding and config files are pretty god, but lack of extension still makes its browsing experience a pain in the ass.
Pity to admit that there is no browser decent enough to use. May switch to other mainstream browser like Firefox or Brave some day.

Text editing: vim for certain. And I use helix (a post-modern editor) as well. It's pretty cool, and looks amazing out of the box.

### Utilities
File manager: vifm for terminal, pcmanfm for GUI. I use a pretty clumsy way to have image preview in vifm. Considering to switch to lf.

Music/audio player: moc.

Video player: mpv. Every cool guys already use it.

Torrent client: Transmission-gtk.

Git client: lazygit

Screenshot utility: maim.

Project V client: v2raya.

PDF viewer: zathura.

Image viewer: sxiv.

Application laucher: dmenu_run. dmenu is fxxking great.
